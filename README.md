# Arduino BNC Shield
The Arduino BNC Shield is a very simple way to connect an Arduino to one or more BNC 
cables.

Especially in science, it is very common to use an Arduino to trigger a camera or behavioral system or LED from a computer, and most of the commercially available devices that are triggered have BNC input connections. This often leads to flaky and problematic ways of connecting the Arduino to the BNC cable, and thus experimental setups that are delicate.  This simple shield aims to address this problem.

## Features

## Build Instructions

## Getting one
The Arduino BNC Shield can be ordered easily and cheaply from any PCB board house (such as [pcbway](pcbway.com), [jlcpcb](jlcpcb.com), etc)  using the zipped gerber files in `bnc_shield_pcb/bnc_shield_gerbers.zip`.  Many board houses have a deal for 5 PCBs of this size for under $10 plus shipping. The only other parts you need are an Arduino Uno, some BNC jacks, and some header to connect the shield to the Arduino. The whole thing can then be easily and quickly assembled even by someone with no soldering experience using only a soldering iron and solder.
